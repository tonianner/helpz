# Project#3 for WDI9 at GA

## Intro
Helpz is a place where people who *love* what they do *helpz* you get things done at an unbeatable value. I was inspired by [fiverr.com](https://www.fiverr.com/) for this project, so this is a scalled down replica version and I wanted to focus on the ordering features of updating each order with status.
